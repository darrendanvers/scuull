# Service Router and Authentication manager for the Scuull Application

It uses Spring Boot and Zuul to do all the heavy lifting for the routing.

All configuration can be found in [application.yaml](src/main/resources/application.yaml).

I based the JWT security features on XOOR's blog post 
on [Medium](https://medium.com/@xoor/jwt-authentication-service-44658409e12c).
