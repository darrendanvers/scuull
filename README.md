# Scuull

A work-in-progress.

I'm re-learning front-end web development from the ground up, and using this
as a project to build something concrete. It's a UI that will display job
history information from the 
[Spring Batch] (https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) metadata tables.

## Running Locally

In the topmost directory, type in:

    docker-compose build
    docker-compse up

## Complete

- A Postgress Docker image with the metadata tables and some sample data.

## In Development
